# NEXUS Protocol Specification
## A Matrix-Aware Multi-Network Transport Protocol

### Abstract

NEXUS (Network Extensive Universal Sharing Protocol) is a novel transport layer protocol designed to support next-generation distributed applications. It operates directly on IP, combining the reliability of TCP with the flexibility of UDP while adding native support for matrix-space positioning, multi-network operations, and built-in security features. This protocol is specifically designed to support applications requiring spatial awareness, multi-dimensional routing, and simultaneous operation across different network types.

### 1. Introduction

Modern distributed systems increasingly operate across multiple network contexts simultaneously - from global public networks to private enterprise networks and peer-to-peer connections. Additionally, many applications require awareness of their position within virtual or physical spaces for optimal routing and operation. NEXUS addresses these needs by providing a unified protocol that supports:

- Matrix-space positioning and routing
- Simultaneous multi-network operation
- Flexible reliability modes
- Native security features
- Efficient path optimization

### 2. Protocol Design

#### 2.1 Core Features

The NEXUS protocol implements several key innovations:

1. **Matrix Awareness**
   - Three-dimensional coordinate system
   - Multiple dimensions and layers
   - Zone-based segmentation
   - Position-aware routing

2. **Multi-Network Support**
   - Simultaneous network connections
   - Network type classification
   - Inter-network bridging
   - Network-specific security contexts

3. **Flexible Transport**
   - Reliable and streaming modes
   - Prioritized packet handling
   - Path optimization
   - Connection migration

#### 2.2 Packet Structure

The NEXUS packet header is designed for efficiency and flexibility:

```c
typedef struct {
    uint8_t  version;              // Protocol version
    uint8_t  type;                 // Packet type
    uint16_t flags;                // Protocol flags
    uint32_t sequence;             // Sequence number
    uint32_t ack;                  // Acknowledgment number
    nexus_network_id_t networks;   // Network context
    nexus_matrix_pos_t position;   // Spatial position
    nexus_token_t token;           // Authentication token
    nexus_hash_t hash;             // Content hash
    // Additional fields...
} nexus_header_t;
```

### 3. Matrix Space

#### 3.1 Positioning System

NEXUS implements a comprehensive positioning system:

- **Coordinates**: X, Y, Z positions in 3D space
- **Dimensions**: Separate namespaces for different virtual/physical spaces
- **Layers**: Subdivisions within dimensions
- **Zones**: Logical groupings of matrix space

#### 3.2 Position-Aware Routing

The protocol optimizes routing based on matrix position:
- Nearest-neighbor discovery
- Path optimization using spatial awareness
- Cross-dimensional routing
- Zone-based traffic management

### 4. Multi-Network Operation

3. **P2P Networks**
   - Direct peer connections
   - Dynamic trust establishment
   - Local discovery

4. **Specialized Networks**
   - Compute networks
   - Storage networks
   - Custom network types

#### 4.2 Network Bridging

The protocol provides secure network bridging:

- Cross-network routing policies
